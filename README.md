Understanding size_t
The type size_t represents the maximum size any object can be in C. It is an unsigned
integer since negative numbers do not make sense in this context. Its purpose is to
provide a portable means of declaring a size consistent with the addressable area of
memory available on a system. The size_t type is used as the return type for the sizeof
operator and as the argument to many functions, including malloc and strlen, among
others.

```
It is good practice to use size_t when declaring variables for sizes such
as the number of characters and array indexes. It should be used for
loop counters, indexing into arrays, and sometimes for pointer
arithmetic.
